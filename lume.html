                    <p>Inspired by coffee sharing pitcher, Lume Outdoor has a large open space below, showing only the tip of the Lume Unit. It has a natural curve on the silhouette, and the significant radius on the cutout makes it looks soft and gentle.</p>
                    <p>The material it uses is PLA bioplastic, which fits the idea of sustainability from Blue Bottle Coffee. This type of material makes it suitable for commercial use such as coffee stores and public spaces.</p>

                    <p>When Lume Outdoor turns on near sunset, it shows a beautiful contrast between the illuminated inner surface and dimmed outer surface. Because of the PLA material, it acts perfectly as a light diffuser that creates a soft gradient light fall.</p>
                    <p>Lume Outdoor is super lightweight that people can easily grab it wherever they want within the Blue Bottle Coffee Store: whether is in-store upper floor or outdoor patio area.</p>

                <p class="spacial-paragraph-1">Coffee helps them stay awake: young people who work at Culver City usually get up early and transport to their office sites around 9am. It is important for them to take in some caffeine in order to keep alert. Caffeine can be absorbed quickly by our bodies and block sleep-promoting receptors in our brain, lasting for almost 6 hours.</p>

Going to coffee stores seems to be a better way of relaxing among this industrialized city. Young people can feel safe and comfort.</p>
